# Self-Healing Machine Learning Pipeline

**Goal:**  
Build a production ready machine learning system that can monitor its own performance, detect when it needs retraining, and automatically update itself - without human intervention.

---

## Problem Statement

In real-world applications, ML models degrade over time due to changing data patterns (data drift, concept drift, etc.). Most pipelines are static - trained once and left untouched, leading to poor performance and business losses. Manual retraining is inefficient and unsustainable at scale.

This project tackles this issue by developing a **self-healing machine learning pipeline** that:

- Trains a model on initial data
- Monitors data and performance drift
- Automatically retrains and redeploys the model when needed
- Maintains version history and audit logs
- Supports CI/CD and containerized deployment

---

## Project Architecture

The pipeline will be built in **modular, layered MVPs** - each layer builds on the previous.

### ✅ Layer 1: Static ML Pipeline

- Build a classical ML model
- Includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation
- Fully modular, with reusable scripts

### ⏳ Layer 2: Workflow Automation

- Add orchestration using Prefect or Airflow (I'll decide which one to go for when the time comes)
- Run the pipeline via schedules or CLI
- Begin versioning models with MLflow

### ⏳ Layer 3: Monitoring + Drift Detection

- Use a framework like evidentlyAI to monitor data and model drift
- Visualize and log drift reports
- Set thresholds for triggering retraining

### ⏳ Layer 4: Self-Healing Logic

- Implement logic to auto-retrain model when drift is detected
- Save new model, update registry, redeploy
- Integrate alerting system for transparency

### ⏳ Layer 5: Production-Readiness

- Containerize pipeline using Docker
- Add CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Structure the codebase for long-term maintainability
